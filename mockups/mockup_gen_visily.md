## Prompt for generating mockup in Visily ->

  

Design a clean, modern web application mockup for an Amazon-style event-driven e-commerce platform with analytics features.   
The UI should have the following pages and sections:  
  
1. Authentication Page  
  - Simple login/signup with email + password  
  - Minimal branding, centered form  
  
2. Product Listing Page  
  - Grid of product cards (image, name, price, rating, “Add to Cart” button)  
  - Top navigation bar with logo, search bar, cart icon, user profile  
  - Sidebar filter (category, price range, ratings)  
  
3. Cart Page  
  - List of selected items with quantity selector and total price  
  - “Proceed to Checkout” button  
  
4. Checkout Flow  
  - Payment method selection  
  - Razorpay/UPI test popup mock  
  - Order summary with status updates (pending → confirmed → shipped)  
  
5. Recommendations Section (on product + cart pages)  
  - Horizontal carousel: “You may also like”  
  - Combination of collaborative + content-based suggestions  
  
6. Orders Page  
  - Table of past orders with status badges (pending, shipped, delivered)  
  
7. Analytics Dashboard (Admin view)  
  - Top metric cards (Total Orders, Revenue, Users, Conversion Rate)  
  - Line chart: Orders per day  
  - Bar chart: Top 5 products sold  
  - Pie chart: Payment methods used  
  - Filter options (daily, weekly, monthly)  
  
Design style:  
- Use modern, minimal components (Next.js + Tailwind aesthetic)  
- Light background, accent colors for charts and buttons  
- Responsive layout (desktop-first but adaptable to mobile)  
- Dashboard look should resemble SaaS admin panels
